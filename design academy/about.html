    <strong>A</strong>rt <strong>M</strong>edia) Lab opened to provide a space for students to explore STEAM and maker space principles.
  The lab is designed around those principles, which emphasize innovative and critical thinking, using technology to creatively solve problems,
  hands-on learning and experimenting, and collaboration and free thinking.<br><br>
  It is home to many different technologies, ranging from 3D printers to a cinema-quality camera, all of which students use to create unique
  projects.<br><br>
  In addition to hosting a variety of classes, the Lab is also generally open to all students in an effort to help prepare them for work and
  life in the 21st century.
