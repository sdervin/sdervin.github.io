    <h2>Design Academy</h2>
    <div class="body"><p>In Design Academy, students follow Stanford's D. School Model
    of Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test to create projects.  Each quarter starts
  with a project proposal, and they spend the remainder of the quarter producing
their project.  Creativity and innovation are emphasized, along with self-directed
inquiry and learning.  Design II is available for students who complete Design I and wish
to expand their use of design thinking.</p></div>

     <h2>AP Computer Science Principles</h2>
     <div class="body"><p>In this class, students are taught the principles of computation,
     including programming, abstractions, algorithms, large data sets, internet,
   cyber security concerns, and computing impacts.  They learn to use to use technology
 to solve real-world issues.  This class is available for students in grades 10-12, and
it aims to broaden computer science participation.</p></div>
